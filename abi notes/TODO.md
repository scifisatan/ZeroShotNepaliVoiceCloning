## Files reviewed: models.py, api.py, se_extractor.py

## Notes
- For input audio splitting, we can compare transribing model or voice activity detection model to see which one gives better result

- we can also make our own nepali transcribing model and show it as our novelty

- we can also remove watermark thing, less features, more simple

- currently the goal is to have a voice cloning system, so let's avoid multilingual or multiaccent stuffs
